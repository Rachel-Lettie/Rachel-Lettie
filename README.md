Hello! I am Rachel Lettie (I prefer Lettie). My pronouns are She/Her or He/Him.

I have extensive experience with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java, Python, and Kotlin. I know a few other languages, but not to the same extent.

I am currently going to a university pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I am in my 4th and final year there.

My biggest interests are WebDev and Mobile Application Dev.
